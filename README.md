## üß† Sentiment Analysis Approach

### Algorithm Overview
Our sentiment analysis engine uses a sophisticated rule-based approach specifically tuned for movie reviews:

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Normalization of text (lowercase, punctuation handling)
   - Word tokenization and filtering
   - Context window analysis

2. **Dictionary-Based Classification**
   - **Positive Words**: 100+ carefully curated positive terms including movie-specific vocabulary
   - **Negative Words**: 100+ negative terms covering criticism and disappointment
   - **Neutral Words**: Balanced terms that indicate moderate opinions

3. **Advanced Features**
   - **Negation Handling**: Detects "not good" vs "good" with context-aware negation
   - **Intensifier Recognition**: Processes "very good" vs "good" with intensity multipliers
   - **Context Windows**: Analyzes 1-3 word context for accurate sentiment modification

4. **Scoring System**
   - Dynamic weight calculation based on word significance
   - Confidence scoring using statistical analysis
   - Percentage breakdown across all sentiment categories

### Example Analysis Process

**Input**: "This movie was not very good, but the cinematography was absolutely stunning."

**Processing**:
1. Tokenize words and identify sentiment indicators
2. Detect "not very good" (negated positive ‚Üí negative)
3. Identify "absolutely stunning" (intensified positive ‚Üí strong positive)
4. Calculate weighted scores and determine overall sentiment

**Output**: Neutral (balanced positive and negative elements) with detailed explanation
